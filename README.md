# Interpreting Household Income of the Black and White Communities in Baltimore, MD and Essex county, MA with Opportunity Atlas Data

## Background
On January 30, 2017, Carrie Wells published an [article](https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-racial-wealth-divide-20170130-story.html) on The Baltimore Sun called _Report highlights economic disparities between races in Baltimore_. In this article, Wells elaborates on the status-quo of the economic disparity between black and white households in Baltimore city and "how deeply segregated by race and how much race is an indicator of economic position in Baltimore". Wells cites a few reports that numerically illustrate how white households have a significantly higher economic status in aspects such as income, owning homes, and bachelor's degree. 

As Wells mentions how the studys' authors did not make any straightforward recommendations to alleviate the problem or "specific policies", CFED "plans on working with six Baltimore nonprofits over the next year to address economic disparities". It has been three and a half years since the publication of this article, but has there been real progress since then? How do we know if CFED has been successful on closing the economic gap between different racial communities in Baltimore? How is the economic disparity like in my high school's county? We will delve more into the data provided by [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org) to further analyze the economic disparities between black and white communities in Baltimore city and my high school county, Essex county, Massachusetts.

## Business Question
_How can Baltimore city and Essex County, MA both decrease the economic gap of household income between the black and white families, and what metrics should the cities measure to monitor their progress?_
## Data Question - Open Data
We'll use open data from one source:
- Opportunity Atlas: this research group constructs ["publicly available atlas of children's outcomes in adulthood by Census tract using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population".](https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/the-opportunity-atlas/) We will be using eight datasets from this platform:
  
     i. Baltimore: Original open data on household income for black and white families in Baltimore, MD.
     
     ii. Essex County: Orginal open data on household income for black and white families in Essex County, MA.
     
     iii. It is important to note that there is a difference in demographics in  two regions in terms of diversity of race. There can be margins of error in these household income data as Essex County is a predominantly white county, while Baltimore is more diverse with a bigger black community.
